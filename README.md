## Status
- Current repo's version is ![Python practice version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/v/nicolasomar/python-practice?color=success&label=%20&style=flat-square)

### What does that version number mean?
| Number | Meaning |
| ------ | ------ |
| `X.0.0` | How many exercises I have completed |
| `0.X.0` | How many times I made progress on my next exercise |
| `0.0.X` | Dependencies version updates and specific patches while the course is not completed |

## Requirements
 - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) `v3` or above

## Setup
After cloning the repo, go to the created folder and install the check its content.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/NicolasOmar/python-practice.git
cd python-practice
```

## How to run it
Each folder might have the following files:
- `theory.py` for concepts explanation.
- `blockchain.py` for improvements in course's main exercise.
- `exercise.py` related to subject's learned lessons.

To run any specific exercise, execute the following command in the project´s folder:
```python
cd folder_name
python3 exercise.py # Or any .py file
```
