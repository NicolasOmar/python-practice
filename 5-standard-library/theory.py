# ---IMPORT---

# Importing modules are similar to how is implemented in javascript
# For example, if you have a file named random.py you can import it like this:
  # import random
# You can also import it with an alias like this:
  # import random as r
# Or you can import specific functions (like randint and shuffle) from a module like this:
  # from random import randint, shuffle
